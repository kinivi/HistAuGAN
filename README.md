# HistAuGAN

GAN-based augmentation technique for histopathological images presented in the paper "Structure-Preserving Multi-Domain Stain Color Augmentation using Style-Transfer with Disentangled Representations" published at MICCAI 2021.

## Demo

HistAuGAN.ipynb

## Prerequisites

* explain different environments for gan and evaluation

## Usage

* explain augmentation function
* explain training of GAN

## Dataset

* Link to Camleyon with own image

## Model

The pretrained Model on the five domains of the Camelyon17 dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/189J7xUyVICBlFD5rblI0WmXrq84xtjfX/view?usp=sharing).

* add lines of code that need to be added to use the model
